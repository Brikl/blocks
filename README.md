Libraries for building custom storefronts with BRIKL

## Developing

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A desktop platform with the [LTS version of NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- You have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed in your machine
- When working with the codebase, we recommend using an IDE with intelligent code completion and syntax highlighting, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

### Downloading the source code

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/brikl/blocks
cd blocks
```

To update the source code to the latest commit, run the following command inside the `blocks` directory:

```shell

### Developing

We are focusing on keeping every applications and libraries to be **type-strict** as much as possible, so every file must be written in TypeScript as much as possible.
